## Main Features

- User management with defined statuses (Active, Inactive, Blocked, Deleted) and roles with associated permissions.
- Full CRUD for tasks, subtasks, categories, tags, milestones, and comments.
- Status and priority control for tasks and subtasks.
- Many-to-many relationships between tasks/subtasks and tags, comments, and attachments.
- Support for attachments with metadata, linked to tasks and subtasks.
- Scheduled notification system associated with tasks.
- Detailed history log for auditing with JSON data.
- User-specific limits configuration including max tasks, tasks per milestone, tags, categories, subtasks per task, comments, milestones, and attachment storage.

## Installation

### 1. Requirements

- Docker installed
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis service
- r-filestorage service ([Repository](https://github.com/HormigaDev/r-filestorage)) (Optional if you modify `src/modules/attchments` accordingly)

### 2. Copy and configure `.env` and `r-backups.json` files

```bash
cp .env.template .env
cp .docker/.env.template .env
cp r-backups.json.template r-backups.json
```

Configure all environment variables correctly.

### 3. Run the Docker image

```bash
cd .docker/
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Create the database

- Manually create the database using the files in `src/database/` in the following order:
    - `types.sql`: Contains custom types required.
    - `init.sql`: Contains all tables used by the API.
    - `functions.sql`: Functions required by the database.
    - `triggers.sql`: Contains automatic update triggers for `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.
    - `indexs.sql`: Contains necessary indexes for performance.
- Alternatively, use the provided binary to set up the database automatically:
    - Ensure `r-backups.json` is configured based on `r-backups.json.template`.
    - Enter the active container:

```bash
docker exec -it app-tasks-api bash
```

- Run:

```bash
npm run db:create
```

### 5. Run the project in development mode

```bash
docker exec -it app-tasks-api bash
```

Then run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

### 6. Change the default user password

Generate a password hash:

```bash
npm run gen:pass YourStrongPassword@123
```

Update the user in the database:

```sql
update users
set password = '<hash>' -- Replace <hash> with the generated hash
where id = 1;
```

### 7. Verify the API

Visit `localhost` at the port configured in `.docker/.env` (`APP_PORT`), e.g., https://localhost:3000. You will receive a JSON response with API status, name, and version.

### 8. Obtain a user TOKEN (If `AUTH_METHOD=bearer` in `.env`)

Send a `POST` request to `http://localhost/auth/login` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "email": "admin@admin.com",
    "password": "YourStrongPassword@123"
}
```

The response will return the token:

```json
{
    "token": "JWT_TOKEN"
}
```

Use this token in the `Authorization` header for all API requests.
